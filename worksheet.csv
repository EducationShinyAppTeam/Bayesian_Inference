HT,Binomial,1,What is the null hypothesis in this situation?,What value would p take if nothing had changed?,The null hypothesis would be that \(p_0\) = 0.25,,
HT,Binomial,2,"If the null hypothesis is true, how does the p-value change with greater sample sizes? How does the confidence interval change?","Remember - when you pick a value from a probability model, any percentile would be just as likely as any other.",When the null hypothesis is true then the p-values would just be random numbers chosen uniformly between 0 and 1 so any value has the same chances as any other value. Confidence intervals would become narrower as values away from the null would become less and less compatible with the data.,,
HT,Binomial,3,"If the hypothesis that p = 0.25 is true, what kind of p-values would you get if you were testing other hypotheses?  How would that be affected by sample size?",Testing another value means we would be assuming that value is true in calculating the p-value.,If p was 0.25 but we were testing a different value then we’d expect smaller and smaller p-values with bigger samples,,
HT,Binomial,4,"If some other hypothesis was true (e.g. p = 0.4), how does the p-value for testing the null change with greater sample sizes?",With larger sample sizes is it easier or harder to detect differences from the null?,"If p was 0.4 but we were testing our null value of  \(p_0\) = 0.25, then we’d expect smaller and smaller p-values with bigger samples.",,
HT,Binomial,5,"If some other hypothesis was true (e.g. p = 0.4), what would the p-value function look like for different hypotheses?  How would that be affected by sample size?","What values of p would give you the smallest p-values, what values of p would give you the largest p-values?",The p-value function would become more and more concentrated around p = 0.4 and thus show smaller and smaller values when p was away from that.,,

BI,Binomial,1,What is the prior distribution for p this situation?,Can you find values of a and b that fit the information about the prior situation?,When \(\alpha = 0.5\) and \(\beta = 1.5\) then E(p) = 0.25 and SD(p) = 0.25,,
BI,Binomial,2,"If the true value of p was really 0.25, How would the posterior distribution of p change with greater sample sizes? How does the credible region change?",Does a larger sample size increase or decrease uncertainty?,More data should make the posterior look more and more concentrated around p = 0.25 which in turn will make the credible region shorter and shorter around that value.,,
BI,Binomial,3,"If the true value of p was really 0.40, How would the posterior distribution of p change with greater sample sizes? If the sample size was fixed at n=25, how does the posterior distribution change with different priors? How does the credible region change?",Think about how much influence the prior has as the sample size grows and what the data is likely to show in comparison to what the prior would imply.,"With larger sample sizes the posterior would move away from the prior and then with large samples become more and more concentrated around the value of p = 0.4.  Thus, with small sample sizes the credible region would widen since values around both 0.25 and 0.40 would look plausible – but with large sample sizes, the effect of the prior would be negligible and the credible region would become narrower around p =0.4.",,
BI,Binomial,4,"If the sample size was fixed at n = 25 and the true value of p was really 0.4,  how might the Bayes factor for comparing the p = 0.4 hypothesis to the p = 0.25 hypothesis come out for your random sample?  What kind of Bayes factors do you see for other hypotheses?",When the true p is 0.4 which values of p would look more likely than p = 0.25 and which would look less likely?,"The Bayes factor will depend quite a bit on the particular random sample obtained.  Generally, you would expect value of p close to 0.4 to have the biggest values (and values of p farther away from 0.4 than \(p_c\) = 0.25 should have values less than 1).  This pattern would be clearer if the sample size was larger.",,
